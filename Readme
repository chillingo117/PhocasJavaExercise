Random list of names was generated from http://www.randat.com/

Manual tests were done for testing the CLI interface.
The app is now functional, but some minor improvements to code quality could be made.

When the app is started up, Resources reads the available information pool from the resources folder. This information
forms the general pool from which People attributes can be randomly selected.

The Main class starts and stops the app, and controls the overall user interface flow.
UserIO is controlled by Main, and is responsible for getting valid user input from the user and printing information.
UserIO accesses Db and Query to provide user requested behaviour such as resampling and printing queried information.
Queries are made through the Query class, which pulls data from Db and transforms it into the requested query.
These queries are then formatted for readability, then printed for the user by UserIO.

When resampling, Db wipes itself, then creates X random people through PersonGenerator.
PersonGenerator generates a random person by randomly selecting attributes from Resources (name and country).
These people are then inserted into the database.
